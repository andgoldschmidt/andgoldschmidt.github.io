I am an IC Postdoctoral Fellow in quantum computing at the University of Chicago with [Fred Chong](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/). I work on _novel control and readout schemes for gate-based quantum computing_. You can find my [resume here](/goldschmidt_andy_2025.pdf).

I did my PhD in Physics with [Nathan Kutz](https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/) at the University of Washington, as part of the NSF [AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](https://dynamicsai.org/). I also worked with Lawrence Livermore National Lab as an NSF Quantum Network Fellow and the [Pacific Northwest Research Institute](https://pnri.org/dudley-lab/) as a student researcher. I was previously employed at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio performing risk assessments by modeling complex systems. I did my BS in Math and Physics at The Ohio State University.
