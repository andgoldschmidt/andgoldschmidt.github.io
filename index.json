It is a standalone suite of numerical differentiation methods for noisy time series data written in Python.\nThe goal is to provide some common numerical differentiation techniques that showcase improvements that can be made on finite differences when data is noisy. The package binds these common differentiation methods to a single easily implemented differentiation interface to encourage user adaptation.\nDerivative is a contribution to PySINDy, an open source Python package for the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy).\nAt some point, I\u0026rsquo;ll write a post about my version of total variational regularization (see the figure above). I adapted a technique from The solution path of the generalized lasso (DOI: 10.1214/11-AOS878) by R.J. Tibshirani \u0026amp; J.
